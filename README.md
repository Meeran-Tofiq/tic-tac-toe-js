# tic-tac-toe-js

This is a game of tic-tac-toe that can be played on any browser. It's logic is coded using javascript.

This project was made to showcase my ability to use factory functions and modules to program the logic behind the game; while keeping in mind proper techniques of structuring code to make it as future-proof as possile.
